Much has been written on getting set up with Python, therefore this post just references external guides that I have hand picked from various sources for you.

In short, this is covering:

* Installing Python 3, pip and virtualenv
* Understanding pip and virtualenv

This will give you the ability to manage your various Python projects in an organised manner. Once this is done, we can begin to start our various test projects which will come in the following posts within the series.


**Installing Python 3**

Python has two major versions 2 and 3 still in use. In these series of posts, we will work with Python 3. This is simply due to the fact that Python 2 has an End Of Life date set for 2020. The major and relevant libraries that we will be using in this series are now compatible with Python 3.


* Details on installing Python 3 for [macOS][macOS], [Windows][Windows] or [Chromebook][Chromebook] (Skip *Bonus: Virtual Environments* section)

* Details on Python 2 vs Python 3, see [here][py2vpy3].

**Installing pip and virtualenv, and understanding them**

The best guide I could find that combines robust installation steps as well as a sufficient explanation of pip and virtualenv can be found [here][pipvenv].

**Summary**

The end result from following the above guides should be that you are able to switch between Python virtual environments (which I'll refer to as a virtualenv from this point forward). Once you are able to do this, you are ready to begin!

If you are experiencing any trouble, please do contact me via email. I will be more than happy to help.
