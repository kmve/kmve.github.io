Currently a Principal Software Tester at FanDuel, the leading daily fantasy sports company in the US and Canada. With over twelve years experience in software engineering, functional and performance testing across financial, healthcare and daily fantasy sports industries, I have been helping organisations become more effective and efficient in delivering quality products and services to markets. Enthusiastic about Python, maths and music; I also enjoy spending time with family, friends, and playing football.
